Each triangle should be equilateral, so it's needed one chain of these triangles types, connected by points.

## Algorithm

1. Choose n triangles
2. Generate one random point
3. Decide where go
	- 3.1. Choose one of six places that will be a triangle vertex
4. Have space to this point?
	- 4.1. No
		- Go to another point:
	- 4.2. Yes
		- Move
5. Run all steps below the first step with n times
